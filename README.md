The ultimate goal was to create a dynamic dashboard that updates in real time as new data is added to a particular document. We did this by using custom menu options like "Update Dashboard" and "Run Script". The "Update Dashboard" function updates the data from the main document, called AppS, to the dashboard document, ensuring that any changes or changes are immediately reflected "Run Script" function Allows additional input simple features, such as devices, updated date and time , are provided by corresponding increase counters. Additionally, we made adjustments to accurately calculate and display these summaries, and to ensure that they are all reliably presented These adjustments contribute to a more efficient and user-friendly experience when you are viewing data in Google Sheets using a custom App Script.
